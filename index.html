                <p class="text">I have heard many of his old speeches in youtube that he addressed at schools and
                    colleges , so
                    inspired he not only made the youth present aware of the problems India was facing but he also saw
                    what India would
                    face in the future. He also came up with great solutions . The best quote i loved is DREAM DREAM
                    DREAM , DREAMS
                    TRANSFORM INTO THOUGHTSAND THOUGHTS RESULT IN ACTION . It looks just simple three line quote but has
                    a lot of meaning.My mom explained to me that this is actually the basic principle , which many of us
                    fail to realize an abide
                    by throughout our lives. I love his stylish long grey hair curled into his face. A true leader, a
                    visionary, a
                    great scientist , peoples president. For me his life history has truely ignited my mind and inspired
                    me that I
                    consider him a true hero </p>
